		Welcome to my home page! I'm excited to see you here. Allow me to tell you guys a little bit about myself
	 	without getting too carried away. My name is Brynner Hidalgo. I am 27 years old and I was born and raised in The
		Dominican Republic but I do reside in NYC now. I recently decided to make a career change and become a web
		developer! After obtaining my AS in Engineering Science and being a year away from finishing my BA in Physics,
		I decided to change directions and focus on something new. Im excited to start this new journey and see where
		it takes me. I, personally, love to learn new things and being able to have fun while doing so is super
		important to me. But anyways, enough about my educational background. There are many other things I enjoy
		doing; Things like playing sports and video games with my friends and drinking wine. I also <em>LOVE</em>
		Astronomy, Astrophotography, and learning about the universe, hence why I was studying Physics for a
		while. I am also very adventurous although I consider myself to be an introvert and enjoy being home a
		lot, I do enjoy the outdoors and going on hikes to enjoy mother nature away from the crowded city life. Anyways, that's enough about me! 
		If you'd like to follow what I do, consider following me on <a href="
		https://twitter.com/brynnerh_">  social media </a> or better yet, 
		if you haven't done so already, consider <a href="member sign up.html"> signing up </a> and becoming a member on this site! <br><br> Oh but wait, you didnt think I'd leave you guys empty handed, right? of course not! Below you can find some of my favorite night sky photographs. I hope that you like them as much as I do.<br><br> Enjoy!
